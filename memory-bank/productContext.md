# Product Context: DummyAIAgent

**Why this project exists:**
This project serves as a technical demonstration for a 2-hour interview. Its purpose is to showcase the ability to rapidly prototype a functional application incorporating several technologies (Rails, Hotwire, external APIs, AI).

**Problem it solves (for the user of the prototype):**
It provides a simplified, conversational interface for:
*   Discovering products from a catalog.
*   Getting AI-driven assistance in choosing products.
*   Simulating the process of placing an order without actual payment.

**How it should work (User Experience Goals):**
*   **Intuitive Chat:** Users should be able to naturally type messages and receive clear responses.
*   **Helpful AI:** The AI agent should understand basic queries about products, offer relevant suggestions, and guide the user through the order process smoothly.
*   **Clear Product Information:** When products are presented, key details should be visible.
*   **Simple Order Process:** The information required for an order should be collected logically.
*   **Responsive Interface:** Thanks to Hotwire, UI updates (like new messages) should feel quick and seamless.

**Target Users (of the prototype):**
*   Primarily, the interviewer(s) assessing the technical skills and problem-solving approach.
*   Secondarily, it simulates an end-user interacting with a novel e-commerce chat agent.
