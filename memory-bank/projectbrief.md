# Project Brief: DummyAIAgent

**Project Name:** DummyAIAgent

**Core Goal:** To build a simple AI-powered e-commerce chat agent within a 2-hour technical interview timeframe. The agent should allow users to browse a product catalog (via DummyJSON API), receive product recommendations (via OpenAI), and simulate placing an order.

**Project Scope Category:** Research/Proof of Concept

**Development Intent:** Time-Boxed Deliverable (working prototype)

**Primary Success Metric:** A functional prototype demonstrating the core user flow: chat -> product discovery -> AI-assisted selection -> order information collection -> simulated order creation.

**Key Constraints:**
*   Strict 2-hour implementation limit.
*   Manual testing only.
*   Focus on core functionality over polish or advanced features.
*   Adherence to `rules/TIMEBOX_STRATEGY.md`.
