# Active Context: DummyAIAgent (PoC)

**Current Work Focus:** All planned tasks for the PoC are complete. Project is ready for submission, pending manual GitHub push by the user.

**Most Recent Actions:**
*   Implemented "Start new chat" functionality.
*   Implemented conversation list sidebar and navigation.
*   Refined UI styling and added collapsible sidebar.
*   Fixed HTML comment typo.
*   Committed UI refinement changes.
*   Updated `README.md` with comprehensive project details.
*   Committed README update.
*   Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect completion of all tasks.

**Immediate Next Step(s):**
1.  User to resolve local Git credential issue.
2.  User to manually push the `DummyAIAgent` repository to GitHub:
    *   `cd DummyAIAgent`
    *   `git remote add origin https://github.com/freebeiro/dummy-ai-agent.git` (if not already added or if re-adding after fixing credentials)
    *   `git branch -M main`
    *   `git push -u origin main`
3.  Submit the PoC.

**Active Decisions & Considerations:**
*   All bootstrapping files (`rules/`, `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, `memory-bank/`) were created.
*   The 2-hour time constraint is paramount and will guide all subsequent development decisions.
*   The project will be developed in the `/Users/freebeiro/Documents/fcr/claudefiles/new-test-rag-project` directory, with the Rails app itself being a subdirectory (`DummyAIAgent/`).

**Important Patterns/Preferences Currently in Use:**
*   Following `NEW_PROJECT_BOOTSTRAP.md` workflow.
*   Adhering to the generated `rules/*.md` files once development begins.
*   Prioritizing tasks as outlined in `PROJECT_PLAN.md` and `rules/TIMEBOX_STRATEGY.md`.

**Recent Learnings/Project Insights:**
*   Successfully navigated environment setup for correct Ruby/Rails versions using `.tool-versions`.
*   Full project requirements and constraints have been clarified.
*   Tech stack (Rails 7.1, Hotwire, Ruby 3.2.x, DummyJSON, OpenAI) is confirmed.
*   A structured plan for the 2-hour PoC is in place.
