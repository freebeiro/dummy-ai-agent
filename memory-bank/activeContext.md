# Active Context: DummyAIAgent (PoC)

**Current Work Focus:** All planned tasks for the PoC are complete. OpenAI integration is now working after API key update by the user. Project is ready for submission.

**Most Recent Actions:**
*   User confirmed new OpenAI API key is in `.env` and working.
*   Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect API key resolution and successful OpenAI integration.

**Immediate Next Step(s):**
1.  Commit final Memory Bank updates.
2.  User to manually push the `DummyAIAgent` repository to GitHub. This may require using the "allow secret" link from GitHub due to historical commits containing the old API key.
    *   Commands:
        ```bash
        cd DummyAIAgent
        git add memory-bank/progress.md memory-bank/activeContext.md 
        git commit -m "Finalize Memory Bank for PoC completion"
        git push origin main 
        ```
3.  Submit the PoC.

**Active Decisions & Considerations:**
*   All bootstrapping files (`rules/`, `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, `memory-bank/`) were created.
*   The 2-hour time constraint is paramount and will guide all subsequent development decisions.
*   The project will be developed in the `/Users/freebeiro/Documents/fcr/claudefiles/new-test-rag-project` directory, with the Rails app itself being a subdirectory (`DummyAIAgent/`).

**Important Patterns/Preferences Currently in Use:**
*   Following `NEW_PROJECT_BOOTSTRAP.md` workflow.
*   Adhering to the generated `rules/*.md` files once development begins.
*   Prioritizing tasks as outlined in `PROJECT_PLAN.md` and `rules/TIMEBOX_STRATEGY.md`.

**Recent Learnings/Project Insights:**
*   Successfully navigated environment setup for correct Ruby/Rails versions using `.tool-versions`.
*   Full project requirements and constraints have been clarified.
*   Tech stack (Rails 7.1, Hotwire, Ruby 3.2.x, DummyJSON, OpenAI) is confirmed.
*   A structured plan for the 2-hour PoC is in place.
