**Known Issues/Blockers:** 
*   GitHub push may still be blocked by secret scanning due to historical commits containing the old (invalid) API key. User will need to "allow secret" on GitHub if prompted. [Status: Pending User Action]

*   Rule files generated to guide development.
*   High-level project plan established.
