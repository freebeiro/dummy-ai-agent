# Git Workflow (DummyAIAgent PoC)

*   **Repository:** Initialize a Git repository at the very beginning of the project.
*   **Branching:** All work will be done on the `main` (or `master`) branch. No feature branches for this 2-hour PoC to save time.
*   **Commits:**
    *   Commit frequently after small, logical changes (e.g., "Initialize Rails app", "Add Chat model and controller", "Implement basic message display").
    *   Write clear, concise commit messages in the present tense (e.g., "Add User model", "Implement product listing").
*   **Pushing:** Push to the remote GitHub repository (to be created by the user at the end) after significant milestones or at the end of the session.
*   **Tagging:** Optionally, tag the final commit before submission (e.g., `v0.1-interview-submission`).
*   **README.md:** Update `README.md` at the end with any notes on approach, shortcuts taken due to time, or thoughts for future improvements, as per assignment instructions.
